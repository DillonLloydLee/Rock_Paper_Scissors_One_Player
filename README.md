#### _Rock Paper Scissors for One Player vs. Computer Opponent, August 12th, 2015_

#### by _**Dillon Lloyd Lee & Brian Borealis**_

## Description

_This app is the classic game of Rock Paper Scissors!  The human player inputs either "Rock," "Paper," or "Scissors" from the main page, then an invisible, computer-controlled opponent will randomly choose a like action.  Will you defeat this villainous computer?_

## Tech Used

Made using HTML, PHP, Silex, Twig, and Composer.

Tests done using PHPTest.

## Setup

* _Clone the directory from "https://github.com/DillonLloydLee/Rock_Paper_Scissors_One_Player.git"_
* _Before you begin, run "composer install" on the root folder from the terminal._
* _Host the web folder from a PHP server._
* _That's it.  The rest should just be user input once the app is up and running._
